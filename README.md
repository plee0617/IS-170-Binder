# Regression Analysis
Regression analysis is a way of mathematically sorting out which variables does indeed have an impact. It answers the questions: Which factors matter most? Which can we ignore? How do those factors interact with one another? And, most importantly, how certain are we about all these factors? In regression analysis, those factors are called “variables.” You have your dependent variable — the main factor that you’re trying to understand or predict. It is also a set of statistical methods used for the estimation of relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It can be utilized to assess the strength of the relationship between variables and for modeling the future relationship between them.
