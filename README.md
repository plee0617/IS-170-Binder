# K-means Clustering
K-means clustering is defined as one of the simplest, yet popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The steps usually follows in which you'll define a target number 'k' referring to the number of centroids you need in the dataset. The centroid is the imaginary or location representing the center of the cluster. This algorithm's purpose is to identify the k number of centroid, making it allocate every data point to the nearest cluster, all while keeping the centroids as small as possible.
