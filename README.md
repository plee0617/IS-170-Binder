# Regression Models
Machine Learning Regression is a technique for investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. Itâ€™s used as a method for predictive modelling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes. Solving regression problems is one of the most common applications for machine learning models, especially in supervised machine learning. Algorithms are trained to understand the relationship between independent variables and an outcome or dependent variable. The model can then be leveraged to predict the outcome of new and unseen input data, or to fill a gap in missing data.
