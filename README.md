# Text mining & Natural language processing (NLP)
Text mining, also known as text analysis, is the process of transforming unstructured text into structured data in order for the analysis to be easy. It uses a natural language processing (NLP), which allows for machines to understand how the human language is; also allowing for it to process automatically. In shorter terms, it is an artificial intelligence technology that uses NLP to transform the text in documents and databased into structured data suitable for machine learning algorithms.
