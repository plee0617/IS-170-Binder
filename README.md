# Association Rules
Association rule mining finds interesting associations and relationships among large sets of data items. This rule shows how frequently a itemset occurs in a transaction. A typical example is a Market Based Analysis. Market Based Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large relations to show associations between items. It allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy together frequently. Given a set of transactions, we can find rules that will predict the occurrence of an item based on the occurrences of other items in the transaction.
