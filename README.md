Machine Learning Applications Binder

IS 170 - Stephen Choi- Spring 2023

Pang Yia Lee

**Executive Summary**

This binder dedicated to IS170 is for the sole purpose of summarizing our coding work, as well as to prove our understanding of the machine learning algorithm and the course's topics over the period of the semester. It is going to contain all the algorithms and work we've covered and done throughout the class, put together in a more cohesive way where we're able to view each section in a more clean and detailed manner. As our class was about Machine Learning: a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way human learns, all of the following works are going to be related to that.
